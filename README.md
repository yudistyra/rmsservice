#### Project Lombok

This project is use Project Lombok. Project Lombok is an open source library for Java that helps reuse repetitive code and save timeduring development through annotations. 

Lombok generates code, for example, getters, setters, and toString, and the IDE does the same thing for us only it generates in our source code while Lombok generates it in the ".class" file directly.

Install Project Lombok to avoid issues on IDE. Find Lombok Project official documentation at: [https://projectlombok.org/](https://projectlombok.org/)
